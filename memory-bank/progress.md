# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.5.2 - Parallel CI/CD & Enhancements)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside the determined `PROJECT_ROOT` and rejects absolute paths.
- **Enhanced Path Error Reporting:**
    - Error messages from `resolvePath` now include user path, resolved path, and project root for better debugging context.
    - `readContent` handler now returns detailed error messages for `ENOENT` (File not found) errors, including resolved path, relative path, and project root.
- **Project Root Determination:** Logic updated to use the server's current working directory (`process.cwd()`) as the `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling operation relative to the agent's context _if launched correctly_.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT` (with enhanced reporting).
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case) have passed basic functional tests.
- **Reliable Batch Error Handling:** All tools supporting multiple items/operations (e.g., `delete_items`, `edit_file`, `write_content`) now consistently attempt all items and return detailed individual results (success/failure/skipped + error message).
- **`edit_file` Tool (Basic Implementation):** Added new tool with support for insertion, text search/replace/delete, indentation preservation, and diff output. Zod schema defined and integrated. Tested with multiple files and mixed outcomes (success/skipped/fail). Return structure fixed for MCP compliance.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage instructions, detailed feature descriptions, Docker instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Descriptions for `write_content` and `edit_file` now include notes recommending edit tools for modifications.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly.
  - Build process debugged and corrected.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - Workflow successfully automates publishing to npm and Docker Hub.
  - **Parallel Publishing:** Workflow refactored to use separate, parallel jobs for npm and Docker publishing, dependent on a shared build job using artifacts.
- **Versioning:** Package version consistently incremented (updated to `0.5.1`, preparing for `0.5.2`).
- **`.clinerules` Created:** Established `memory-bank/.clinerules` to capture project-specific patterns and user preferences.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Rebuild & Restart Server:** Need to rebuild (`npm run build`) and restart the server locally if testing changes other than CI/CD.
- **Test Error Reporting & Descriptions:** Verify enhanced error messages and updated tool descriptions locally.
- **Test Dynamic Root Logic:** Verify the server operates correctly when launched with different `cwd` settings locally.
- **Launcher Integration Testing:** Confirm the system launching the server sets the `cwd` appropriately.
- **Versioning:** Update `package.json` to `0.5.2` and potentially create a git tag.
- **CI/CD Verification:** Monitor the next push to `main` to ensure the parallel jobs run correctly.
- **Resolve `list_files` Issue (Glob Path):** (Lower priority) Investigate the `glob`-based execution path within `handleListFiles`.
- **Comprehensive Testing (Post-Root Change):** Re-test core functionality, edge cases, permissions (`chmod`/`chown`), cross-device moves/copies in the context of the dynamic root.
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining debugging logs.
- **`edit_file` Regex Support:** Implement regex matching for search patterns.

## 3. Current Status

- **Project Root Logic Updated:** Server now uses `process.cwd()` for the project root.
- **Core Functionality Implemented:** All defined tools are implemented and passed basic tests. Batch error handling confirmed. Path error reporting enhanced. Tool descriptions updated.
- **Deployment Automated:** Publishing to npm and Docker Hub is handled by GitHub Actions, now configured for parallel execution.
- **Documentation Updated (Internal & Public):** Memory Bank files updated. `README.md` updated.
- **Primary Blocker:** Need to test the parallel CI/CD workflow on the next push. Locally, need to rebuild, restart, and test the enhanced error reporting and description changes, then test the dynamic root behavior thoroughly and ensure the launcher integration works as expected before releasing `0.5.2`.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality is now critically dependent on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Potential issue with recursion/stats enabled needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
