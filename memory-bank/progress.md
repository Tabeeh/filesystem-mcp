# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.5.5 Release)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside the determined `PROJECT_ROOT` and rejects absolute paths.
- **Enhanced Path Error Reporting:**
    - Error messages from `resolvePath` now include user path, resolved path, and project root for better debugging context.
    - `readContent` handler now returns detailed error messages for `ENOENT` (File not found) errors, including resolved path, relative path, and project root.
- **Project Root Determination:** Logic updated to use the server's current working directory (`process.cwd()`) as the `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling operation relative to the agent's context _if launched correctly_.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT` (with enhanced reporting).
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case) have passed basic functional tests.
- **Reliable Batch Error Handling:** All tools supporting multiple items/operations (e.g., `delete_items`, `edit_file`, `write_content`) now consistently attempt all items and return detailed individual results (success/failure/skipped + error message).
- **`edit_file` Tool (Basic Implementation):** Added new tool with support for insertion, text search/replace/delete, indentation preservation, and diff output. Zod schema defined and integrated. Tested with multiple files and mixed outcomes (success/skipped/fail). Return structure fixed for MCP compliance.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage instructions, detailed feature descriptions, Docker instructions, and contribution guidelines.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Descriptions for `write_content` and `edit_file` now include notes recommending edit tools for modifications.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly.
  - Build process debugged and corrected.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - **Simplified Single Workflow (`publish.yml`):** Handles both CI checks (build only on main push) and Releases (build with artifacts, parallel publish, auto-release on tag push).
  - **Conditional Artifacts:** Build job uploads artifacts only when triggered by a tag push.
  - **Conditional Publishing/Release:** Publish and release jobs run only when triggered by a tag push.
  - **Artifact Handling Fixed:** Corrected artifact creation and extraction.
- **Versioning:** Package version updated to `0.5.5`.
- **`.clinerules` Created:** Established `memory-bank/.clinerules` to capture project-specific patterns and user preferences.
- **Changelog:** Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with entry for v0.5.5.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Commit & Push Simplified Workflow:** Commit the deleted/updated workflow files and Memory Bank files. Push to `origin main`.
- **Create & Push v0.5.5 Tag:** Create and push the `v0.5.5` tag to trigger the release workflow.
- **Monitor CI/CD:**
    - Verify pushes to `main` trigger `publish.yml` but only run the `build` job (without artifact upload).
    - Verify the push of `v0.5.5` tag triggers `publish.yml` and successfully runs all jobs (build with upload, publish-npm, publish-docker, create-release).
- **Implement `edit_file` Regex Support:** (Post-release task) Add logic for `use_regex: true`.
- **Code Cleanup:** (Post-release task) Remove any remaining debugging logs.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** (Post-release task) Test dynamic root logic, launcher integration, edge cases, etc.

## 3. Current Status

- **Release Prep Complete:** Version bumped to `0.5.5`, `CHANGELOG.md` updated.
- **CI/CD Simplified:** Refactored back to a single workflow (`publish.yml`) with conditional artifact upload and job execution based on trigger (main push vs tag push).
- **Ready to Commit Simplified Workflow:** Waiting to commit the deleted/updated workflow files and Memory Bank files.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality is now critically dependent on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Potential issue with recursion/stats enabled needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
