# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.5.2 - Enhanced Path Error Reporting)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside the determined `PROJECT_ROOT` and rejects absolute paths.
- **Enhanced Path Error Reporting:** Error messages from `resolvePath` now include user path, resolved path, and project root for better debugging context.
- **Project Root Determination:** Logic updated to use the server's current working directory (`process.cwd()`) as the `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling operation relative to the agent's context _if launched correctly_.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT`.
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case) have passed basic functional tests.
- **Reliable Batch Error Handling:** All tools supporting multiple items/operations (e.g., `delete_items`, `edit_file`, `write_content`) now consistently attempt all items and return detailed individual results (success/failure/skipped + error message).
- **`edit_file` Tool (Basic Implementation):** Added new tool with support for insertion, text search/replace/delete, indentation preservation, and diff output. Zod schema defined and integrated. Tested with multiple files and mixed outcomes (success/skipped/fail). Return structure fixed for MCP compliance.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage instructions (prioritizing `npx`, adding `bunx` alternative), detailed feature descriptions, Docker instructions, and contribution guidelines. JSON examples now correctly omit comments for standard JSON compliance.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly.
  - Build process debugged and corrected (using `npm ci --ignore-scripts`).
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - Workflow (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) successfully automates:
    - Publishing to npm on `main` branch pushes.
    - Building and pushing Docker image to Docker Hub (`shtse8/filesystem-mcp`) on `main` branch pushes.
- **Versioning:** Package version consistently incremented to trigger releases (updated to `0.5.1`, preparing for `0.5.2`).
- **`.clinerules` Created:** Established `memory-bank/.clinerules` to capture project-specific patterns and user preferences, starting with the preference for using edit tools over `write_to_file` for modifications.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Test Dynamic Root Logic:** Verify the server operates correctly when launched with different `cwd` settings representing different projects.
- **Launcher Integration Testing:** Confirm the system launching the server sets the `cwd` appropriately.
- **Versioning:** Update `package.json` to `0.5.2` and potentially create a git tag.
- **CI/CD Verification:** Ensure the pipeline works with the changes for `0.5.2`.
- **Resolve `list_files` Issue (Glob Path):** (Lower priority) Investigate the `glob`-based execution path within `handleListFiles`.
- **Comprehensive Testing (Post-Root Change):** Re-test core functionality, edge cases, permissions (`chmod`/`chown`), cross-device moves/copies in the context of the dynamic root.
- **Code Cleanup:** Remove any remaining debugging logs (e.g., the `console.log` in `pathUtils.ts`).
- **`edit_file` Regex Support:** Implement regex matching for search patterns.

## 3. Current Status

- **Project Root Logic Updated:** Server now uses `process.cwd()` for the project root.
- **Core Functionality Implemented:** All defined tools are implemented and passed basic tests. Batch error handling confirmed. Path error reporting enhanced.
- **Deployment Automated:** Publishing to npm and Docker Hub is handled by GitHub Actions.
- **Documentation Updated (Internal & Public):** Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns`, `productContext`, `techContext`, `activeContext`, `progress`, `.clinerules`) updated. `README.md` updated.
- **Primary Blocker:** Need to test the dynamic root behavior thoroughly and ensure the launcher integration works as expected before releasing `0.5.2`.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality is now critically dependent on the launching process setting the correct `cwd` for the target project. Incorrect `cwd` will lead to operations on the wrong directory.
- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Potential issue with recursion/stats enabled needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
