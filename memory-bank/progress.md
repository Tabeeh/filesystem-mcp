# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (v0.5.8 Release)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization:** The MCP server starts, connects via stdio, and identifies itself correctly.
- **Tool Listing:** Responds correctly to `list_tools` requests.
- **Path Security:** The `resolvePath` function prevents path traversal outside the determined `PROJECT_ROOT` and rejects absolute paths.
- **Enhanced Path Error Reporting:**
    - Error messages from `resolvePath` now include user path, resolved path, and project root for better debugging context.
    - `readContent` handler now returns detailed error messages for `ENOENT` (File not found) errors, including resolved path, relative path, and project root.
- **Project Root Determination:** Logic updated to use the server's current working directory (`process.cwd()`) as the `PROJECT_ROOT`, enabling operation relative to the agent's context _if launched correctly_.
- **Basic Error Handling:** Handles common errors like `ENOENT` (with enhanced reporting).
- **Core Tool Functionality (v0.2.0+):** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`, `list_files` simple case) have passed basic functional tests.
- **Reliable Batch Error Handling:** All tools supporting multiple items/operations (e.g., `delete_items`, `edit_file`, `write_content`) now consistently attempt all items and return detailed individual results (success/failure/skipped + error message).
- **`edit_file` Tool (Basic Implementation):** Added new tool with support for insertion, text search/replace/delete, indentation preservation, and diff output. Zod schema defined and integrated. Tested with multiple files and mixed outcomes (success/skipped/fail). Return structure fixed for MCP compliance.
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Significantly improved with clear usage instructions, detailed feature descriptions, Docker instructions, contribution guidelines, and **Glama.ai badge added**.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Descriptions for `write_content` and `edit_file` now include notes recommending edit tools for modifications.
- **Dockerization:**
  - `Dockerfile` created using multi-stage builds, copies pre-built code, installs production dependencies only.
  - `.dockerignore` configured correctly (removed `build` exclusion).
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):**
  - **Simplified Single Workflow (`publish.yml`):** Handles both CI checks (build only on main push) and Releases (build with artifacts, parallel publish, auto-release on tag push).
  - **Conditional Artifacts:** Build job uploads artifacts only when triggered by a tag push.
  - **Conditional Publishing/Release:** Publish and release jobs run only when triggered by a tag push.
  - **Artifact Handling Fixed:** Corrected artifact creation (`tar` command now includes `build` directory) and extraction.
  - **Diagnostic Steps Added:** Added `ls -la` steps to `publish-docker` job for debugging artifact issues.
- **Versioning:** Package version updated to `0.5.8`.
- **`.clinerules` Created:** Established `memory-bank/.clinerules` to capture project-specific patterns and user preferences.
- **Changelog:** Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with entry for v0.5.8.
- **License:** Added MIT `LICENSE` file.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Commit Changes:** Commit updated `.dockerignore`, `package.json`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and Memory Bank files.
- **Tag Release:** Create git tag `v0.5.8`.
- **Push Commit & Tag:** Push the commit and the new tag to `origin`.
- **Monitor CI/CD:** Verify the `v0.5.8` release workflow completes successfully.
- **Implement `edit_file` Regex Support:** (Post-release task) Add logic for `use_regex: true`.
- **Code Cleanup:** (Post-release task) Remove any remaining debugging logs (including the added `ls -la` steps if successful).
- **Comprehensive Testing:** (Post-release task) Test dynamic root logic, launcher integration, edge cases, etc.

## 3. Current Status

- **Release Prep Complete:** Version bumped to `0.5.8`, `CHANGELOG.md` updated.
- **Docker Build Context Fixed:** Removed `build` exclusion from `.dockerignore`.
- **Ready to Commit & Tag:** Waiting to commit fixes and version updates, then tag `v0.5.8`.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **Docker Build Failure (v0.5.7):** The `v0.5.7` release failed because `.dockerignore` excluded the `build` directory from the Docker context. (Fixed in v0.5.8)
- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality is now critically dependent on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **`list_files` (`glob` path):** Potential issue with recursion/stats enabled needs investigation.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited by the OS.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
