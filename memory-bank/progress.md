# Progress: Filesystem MCP Server (Testing Phase)

## 1. What Works

- **Server Initialization & Core MCP:** Starts, connects, lists tools.
- **Path Security:** `resolvePath` prevents traversal and absolute paths. Enhanced error reporting implemented.
- **Project Root:** Determined by `process.cwd()`.
- **Core Tool Functionality:** Most tools (`create_directories`, `write_content`, `stat_items`, `read_content`, `move_items`, `copy_items`, `search_files`, `replace_content`, `delete_items`) have basic functionality.
- **Batch Error Handling:** Tools attempt all items and report individual results.
- **`edit_file` Tool:** Basic text insertion, replacement, deletion, indentation preservation, diff output implemented and tested.
- **`listFiles` Tool:** Core functionality implemented and tested (integration tests).
- **Documentation (`README.md`):** Improved usage, features, Docker info, contribution, support section, badges.
- **Tool Descriptions:** Updated for `write_content` and `edit_file`.
- **Dockerization:** Multi-stage `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` are functional.
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions):** Single workflow handles CI checks (main push) and releases (tag push) including npm, Docker Hub publishing, and GitHub Release creation. Artifact handling fixed.
- **Versioning:** Package version at `0.5.8`.
- **`.clinerules`:** Created.
- **Changelog:** Updated up to `v0.5.8`.
- **License:** MIT `LICENSE` file added.
- **Funding File:** `.github/FUNDING.yml` added.
- **Testing Framework:** Jest, `ts-jest`, `cross-env` installed and configured (`jest.config.js`, `tsconfig.test.json`). `test` script added.
- **Tests Added:**
    - `editFile`: Unit tests passing (using `unstable_mockModule` + `as any` workaround).
    - `listFiles`: Integration tests passing (using temporary filesystem).

## 2. What's Left to Build / Test

- **Add Tests for Remaining Handlers:**
    - `statItems`
    - `readContent`
    - `writeContent`
    - `deleteItems`
    - `createDirectories`
    - `chmodItems`
    - `chownItems`
    - `moveItems`
    - `copyItems`
    - `searchFiles`
    - `replaceContent`
- **Commit Testing Progress:** Commit new test files, configurations, and `package.json`.
- **Implement `edit_file` Regex Support:** (Post-testing task).
- **Code Cleanup:** (Post-testing task) Remove debugging logs.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** (Post-testing task) Edge cases, permissions, large files, etc.
- **Refine Mocking Strategy:** (Optional) Revisit ESM mocking later.

## 3. Current Status

- **Testing Implementation In Progress:** Successfully added tests for `editFile` and `listFiles` after overcoming significant ESM mocking challenges. Decided to use integration tests for `listFiles`.
- **Ready to Continue:** Prepared to add tests for the next handler.

## 4. Known Issues / Areas for Improvement

- **ESM Mocking Complexity:** Standard Jest mocking techniques (`jest.mock`, `spyOn`) proved unreliable in the current ESM setup. Workarounds (`unstable_mockModule` + `as any`) or alternative strategies (integration testing) were necessary.
- **Launcher Dependency:** Server functionality relies on the launching process setting the correct `cwd`.
- **Windows `chmod`/`chown`:** Effectiveness is limited.
- **Cross-Device Moves/Copies:** May fail (`EXDEV`).
- **Tool Description Updates:** Attempts to modify handler source code via tools failed due to tool limitations/bugs; postponed.
