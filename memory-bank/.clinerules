# Cline Rules for filesystem-mcp Project

## Tool Usage Preferences

- **Prioritize Edit Tools:** When modifying existing files, prefer using `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, or `search_and_replace` over `write_to_file`. `write_to_file` should primarily be used for creating new files or when a complete rewrite is necessary, as it can be less efficient for large files or minor edits.
