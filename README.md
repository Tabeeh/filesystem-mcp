### Example Configuration

You can configure the server by modifying the `config.json` file. Here‚Äôs an example configuration:

```json
{
  "port": 3000,
  "secure": true,
  "allowedAgents": ["Cline", "Claude"]
}
```

### Making Requests

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/files/path/to/your/file
```

### Error Handling

The server returns appropriate HTTP status codes and messages for various error scenarios. For example:

- **404 Not Found**: The requested file does not exist.
- **403 Forbidden**: Access to the file is denied.

## API Documentation üìö
